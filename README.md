2. **Clean the Excel file:** 
    `python -m slprices.scripts.clean_excel`
Creates `input/items_to_price_check_cleaned.xlsx`.

3. **Pull Kroger prices:**  
    `python kroger_api_scraper.py`
Creates `output/kroger_products.csv`.

4. **Scrape Superlo prices:**  
    `scrapy crawl superlo -O output/superlo_products.csv`
(The `-O` argument is required!)

5. **Merge everything into a final report:**  
python -m slprices.scripts.merge_prices
Output: `output/items_to_price_check_updated.xlsx`

### All-in-One Automation

- **Windows:**  
Run `run_all.bat` by double-clicking it.
- **Mac/Linux:**  
Run `./run_all.sh` in your terminal (make it executable with `chmod +x run_all.sh` if needed).

---

### Switching Between Test and Production Modes

- In `slprices/config.py`, set:
```python
TEST_MODE = True   # Use test files for safe/quick runs
TEST_MODE = False  # Use all items for real results
```
All scripts will use the appropriate input files automatically.
